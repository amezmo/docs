# PHP

PHP on Amezmo comes with FPM, and the PHP command line interface. All common extensions that you'd expect
are already installed by default, allowing you to focus on code, not configuration.

## PHP versions

The default PHP version is selected at [instance](/docs/instances) launch time. You may choose any of the available PHP versions.
The choice of PHP version applies to both FPM and the PHP command line interface.

## Available PHP versions

- PHP 5.6
- PHP 7.0
- PHP 7.1
- PHP 7.2
- PHP 7.3
- PHP 7.4
- PHP 8.0
- PHP 8.1
- PHP 8.2
- PHP 8.3
- PHP 8.4

## Changing PHP versions

After an instance is launched, the PHP version may be viewed from the Overview tab. Your PHP version may be changed at anytime.
See [changing PHP versions](/docs/how-to-guides/changing-php-versions) for more details.

## Composer

Composer has been pre-installed and is ready to use. [Learn more](/docs/php/composer)

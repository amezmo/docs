# Advanced Pay

Amezmo funds your account balance with a credit from your Advanced Pay transaction amount using a realtime negative asset balance structure to debit your account balance.

As usage is incurred, your balance is deceremented until it reaches zero.
If your account balance is zero, Amezmo reserves the right to terminate
your sites immediately with no grace period or warning.
However, you can add add a backup payment method which will be
used if your balance is zero.

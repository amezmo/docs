# Create a deployment

You may invoke a deployment on your instance with an optional archive file.
This archive file allows you to upload a complete version of your
application without having to use Git.

A common use case for deploying with an archive file is when
you're using a pipeline provider such as GitHub actions.

See the [Amezmo GitHub Actions](https://github.com/amezmo/github-actions-demo) demo
repository for a guide to Deploying PHP applications
with [GitHub actions](https://www.amezmo.com/laravel-hosting-guides/deploying-laravel-with-github-actions).

Deployments with an [archive file](/docs/how-to-guides/creating-zip-files-for-api-deployments) work exactly
like regular Git deployments.

When deploying with the Amezmo API, The `after.pull`
[deployment hook](/docs/deployments/hooks) will not be run.
Instead, use the [after.extract](/docs/deployments/hooks/after-extract)
hook to run code after extracting your archive.

```http
POST /v1/instances/{instance_id}/deployments
```

# Deployment Triggers

In this section, you will learn about how your
[PHP deployments](/docs/deployments) can begin for your sites.

## PHP Deployment Mechanisms
Atomic PHP deployments take place from an automatic process by which
your [instance](/docs/instances) is aware of changes you make to
your [git repository](/docs/git/repos). Amezmo creates a webhook
in your repository using your selected [integration](/docs/git/providers).
